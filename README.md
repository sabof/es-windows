##### How to use

Each number represents a window. Windows followed by H or V, are internal Horizontal or Vertical splitters. The last window is an external window, showing a buffer.

First you need to select a window on which to operate, by entering it's number. RET will select it. ^, >, v, and < will split it.

It's also possible to enter an operation without specifying a window, in which case the root window will be used.

##### Integration with helm

Add the following code to your init.el:
```elisp
(require 'esw-helm)
```

From helm-find-files, helm-buffer-list, helm-mini, helm-projectile (buffers and files), use *C-c C-w* to call esw to select the target window.
